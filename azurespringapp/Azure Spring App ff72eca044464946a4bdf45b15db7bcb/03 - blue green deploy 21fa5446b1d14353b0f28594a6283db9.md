# 03 - blue green deploy

## **Prepare the app and deployments**

To build the application, follow these steps:

1. Generate the code for the sample app by using Spring Initializr with [this configuration](https://start.spring.io/#!type=maven-project&language=java&platformVersion=2.3.4.RELEASE&packaging=jar&jvmVersion=1.8&groupId=com.example&artifactId=hellospring&name=hellospring&description=Demo%20project%20for%20Spring%20Boot&packageName=com.example.hellospring&dependencies=web,cloud-eureka,actuator,cloud-starter-sleuth,cloud-starter-zipkin,cloud-config-client).
2. Download the code.
3. Add the following *HelloController.java* source file to the folder *\src\main\java\com\example\hellospring*:
    
    JavaCopy
    
    ```
    package com.example.hellospring;
    import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RestController;
    import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RequestMapping;
    
    @RestController
    
    public class HelloController {
    
    @RequestMapping("/")
    
      public String index() {
          return "Greetings from Azure Spring Apps!";
      }
    
    }
    
    ```
    
4. Build the *.jar* file:
    
    Azure CLICopy
    
    ```
    mvn clean package -DskipTests
    
    ```
    
5. Create the app in your Azure Spring Apps instance:
    
    Azure CLICopy
    
    ```
    az spring app create -n demo -g <resourceGroup> -s <Azure Spring Apps instance> --assign-endpoint
    
    ```
    
6. Deploy the app to Azure Spring Apps:
    
    Azure CLICopy
    
    ```
    az spring app deploy -n demo -g <resourceGroup> -s <Azure Spring Apps instance> --jar-path target\hellospring-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
    
    ```
    
7. Modify the code for your staging deployment:
    
    JavaCopy
    
    ```
    package com.example.hellospring;
    import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RestController;
    import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RequestMapping;
    
    @RestController
    
    public class HelloController {
    
    @RequestMapping("/")
    
      public String index() {
          return "Greetings from Azure Spring Apps! THIS IS THE GREEN DEPLOYMENT";
      }
    
    }
    
    ```
    
8. Rebuild the *.jar* file:
    
    Azure CLICopy
    
    ```
    mvn clean package -DskipTests
    
    ```
    
9. Create the green deployment:
    
    Azure CLICopy
    
    ```
    az spring app deployment create -n green --app demo -g <resourceGroup> -s <Azure Spring Apps instance> --jar-path target\hellospring-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
    
    ```
    

**View apps and deployments**

Use the following steps to view deployed apps.

1. Go to your Azure Spring Apps instance in the Azure portal.
2. From the left pane, open the **Apps** pane to view apps for your service instance.

3. Select an app to view details.

4. Open **Deployments** to see all deployments of the app. The grid shows both production and staging deployments.

5. Select the URL to open the currently deployed application.

6. Select **Production** in the **State** column to see the default app.

7. Select **Staging** in the **State** column to see the staging app.

**Tip**

Confirm that your test endpoint ends with a slash (/) to ensure that the CSS file is loaded correctly. If your browser requires you to enter login credentials to view the page, use **[URL decode](https://www.urldecoder.org/)** to decode your test endpoint. URL decode returns a URL in the format `https://\<username>:\<password>@\<cluster-name>.test.azureapps.io/gateway/green`. Use this format to access your endpoint.

**Note**

Configuration server settings apply to both your staging environment and your production environment. For example, if you set the context path (*server.servlet.context-path*) for your app gateway in the configuration server as *somepath*, the path to your green deployment changes to `https://\<username>:\<password>@\<cluster-name>.test.azureapps.io/gateway/green/somepath/...`.

If you visit your public-facing app gateway at this point, you should see the old page without your new change.

**Set the green deployment as the production environment**

1. After you've verified your change in your staging environment, you can push it to production. On the **Apps** > **Deployments** page, select the application currently in **Production**.
2. Select the ellipsis after **Registration status** of the green deployment, and then select **Set as production**.

3. Confirm that the URL of the app displays your changes.
    
    ![https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/spring-apps/media/how-to-staging-environment/new-production-deployment.png](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/spring-apps/media/how-to-staging-environment/new-production-deployment.png)
    

**Note**

After you've set the green deployment as the production environment, the previous deployment becomes the staging deployment.

**Modify the staging deployment**

If you're not satisfied with your change, you can modify your application code, build a new .jar package, and upload it to your green deployment by using the Azure CLI:

Azure CLICopy

```
az spring app deploy  -g <resource-group-name> -s <service-instance-name> -n gateway -d green --jar-path gateway.jar

```

**Delete the staging deployment**

To delete your staging deployment from the Azure portal, go to the page for your staging deployment and select the **Delete** button.

Alternatively, delete your staging deployment from the Azure CLI by running the following command:

Azure CLICopy

```
az spring app deployment delete -n <staging-deployment-name> -g <resource-group-name> -s <service-instance-name> --app gateway
```
