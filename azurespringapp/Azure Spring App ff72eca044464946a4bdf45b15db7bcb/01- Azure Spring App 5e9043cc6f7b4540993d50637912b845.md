# 01- Azure Spring App

**Prerequisites**

- An Azure subscription. If you don't have a subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) before you begin.
- [Azure CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli). Install the Azure Spring Apps extension with the following command: `az extension add --name spring`
- If you're deploying Azure Spring Apps Enterprise tier for the first time in the target subscription, see the [Prerequisites](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/spring-apps/how-to-enterprise-marketplace-offer#prerequisites) section of [View Azure Spring Apps Enterprise tier offering in Azure Marketplace](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/spring-apps/how-to-enterprise-marketplace-offer).

**Provision an instance of Azure Spring Apps**

Use the following steps to provision a service instance.

1. Select **Try It** and sign in to your Azure account in [Azure Cloud Shell](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-shell/overview).
    
    Azure CLICopyOpen Cloudshell
    
    ```
    az account show
    
    ```
    
2. Azure Cloud Shell workspaces are temporary. On initial start, the shell prompts you to associate an [Azure Storage](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-introduction) instance with your subscription to persist files across sessions.

3. After you sign in successfully, use the following command to display a list of your subscriptions.
    
    Azure CLICopyOpen Cloudshell
    
    ```
    az account list --output table
    
    ```
    
4. Use the following command to choose and link to your subscription.
    
    Azure CLICopyOpen Cloudshell
    
    ```
    az account set --subscription <subscription-id>
    
    ```
    
5. Use the following command to create a resource group.
    
    Azure CLICopyOpen Cloudshell
    
    ```
    az group create \
        --resource-group <name-of-resource-group> \
        --location eastus
    
    ```
    
6. Use the following command to create an Azure Spring Apps service instance.
    
    Azure CLICopyOpen Cloudshell
    
    ```
    az spring create \
        --resource-group <name-of-resource-group> \
        --name <service-instance-name>
    
    ```
    
7. Choose **Y** to install the Azure Spring Apps extension and run it.

**Create an app in your Azure Spring Apps instance**

Use the following command to specify the app name on Azure Spring Apps as *hellospring*.

Azure CLICopyOpen Cloudshell

```
az spring app create \
    --resource-group <name-of-resource-group> \
    --service <service-instance-name> \
    --name hellospring \
    --assign-endpoint true

```

**Clone and build the Spring Boot sample project**

Use the following steps to clone the Spring Boot sample project.

1. Use the following command to clone the [Spring Boot sample project](https://github.com/spring-guides/gs-spring-boot.git) from GitHub.
    
    Azure CLICopyOpen Cloudshell
    
    ```
    git clone -b boot-2.7 https://github.com/spring-guides/gs-spring-boot.git
    
    ```
    
2. Use the following command to move to the project folder.
    
    Azure CLICopyOpen Cloudshell
    
    ```
    cd gs-spring-boot/complet*e*
    
    ```
    
3. Use the following [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/what-is-maven.html) command to build the project.
    
    Azure CLICopyOpen Cloudshell
    
    ```
    mvn clean package -DskipTests
    
    ```
    

**Deploy the local app to Azure Spring Apps**

Use the following command to deploy the *.jar* file for the app (*target/spring-boot-complete-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar* on Windows).

Azure CLICopyOpen Cloudshell

```
az spring app deploy \
    --resource-group <name-of-resource-group> \
    --service <service-instance-name> \
    --name hellospring \
    --artifact-path target/spring-boot-complete-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar

```

Deploying the application can take a few minutes.

## **Clean up resources**

If you plan to continue working with subsequent quickstarts and tutorials, you might want to leave these resources in place. When you no longer need the resources, delete them by deleting the resource group. Use the following commands to delete the resource group:

Azure CLICopyOpen Cloudshell

```
echo "Enter the Resource Group name:" &&
read resourceGroupName &&
az group delete --name $resourceGroupName &&
echo "Press [ENTER] to continue ..."
```
